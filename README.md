# Hospital_Management_System_Project
We will implement a hospital management syatem using C++ which streamlines the process of managing medical information, billing, and appointments in hospitals and other healthcare organizations. Symptoms, medical history, medication details, laboratory findings, and billing information are among the data maintained in the system.
